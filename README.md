This project uses [bos-loader](https://github.com/near/bos-loader) v0.10.0 to keep track of the widgets required to implement Community Voice on BOS. 

# How to use
To use it, download bos-loader as [instructed](https://github.com/near/bos-loader/releases/tag/v0.10.0) and run `npm start`. Then, open https://near.org/flags and paste the following: `http://127.0.0.1:3030` and save flags. Then go to the desired widget, assuming user cv.near. As an example, https://near.org/cv.near/widget/HelloCV should work, printing `Hello Community Voice`
